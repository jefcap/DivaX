    <string name="inputvalidationissue1_intro"><b>Objective</b>: Try to access all user data without knowing any user name. There are three users
                             by default and your task is to output data of all the three users with a single malicious search.\n
                             <b>Hint</b>: Improper or no input validation issue arise when the input is not filtered or validated
                             before using it. When developing components that take input from outside, always validate it.
                             For ease of testing there are three users already present in the database, for example one of them is
                             admin, you can try searching for admin to test the output.</string>
